# maze-generator

This project is intended as a learning project for learning Clojure by implementing Maze algorithms from the Book [Mazes For Programmers](http://www.mazesforprogrammers.com) by James Buck.



## Installation

Checkout the source and open up a Leiningen REPL.

## Usage

To print a maze, open up a REPL in the project folder and evaluate One of the following commands :

```
(println (maze-to-string (binary-tree 10) 10))
```
Example output:
```

maze-to-string takes 2 arguments: A maze grid and a row size.


Algorithms So far:

#### Binary tree
```
(binary-tree grid-size)
```
Creates a binary tree maze.  This algorithm is the simplest and has a diagonal bias up towards the northeast side of the grid.

#### Recursive Backtracker
```
(recursive-backtracker maze-grid starting-cell-id)
```
Creates a recursive backtracker maze.  This algorithm is more complex than binary tree and creates long winding passages.  I find these mazes to be more aesthetically pleasing.

#### Example
```
maze-generator.core=> (println (maze-to-string (recursive-backtracker (create-grid 20) (rand-int 400)) 20))

### Bugs
Right now, The only grid type supported is a perfect square.  There is a bug with assigning cell-id to non-square grids.
